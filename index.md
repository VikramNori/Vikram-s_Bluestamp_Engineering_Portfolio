# ISS Tracker
Have you ever thought about the International Space Station? The permanently manned spacecraft in low orbit of the Earth that travels around the Earth at 17,500 miles per hour and is home to many astronauts and cosmonauts? Have you wondered where it is

The project tracks the position of the International Space Station and tells you the location on Earth that the ISS is directly above using the Internet. The PyPortal displays the location and holds the code. The PyPortal's desktop covers it, and makes it look better, and the USB-A to USB-Micro cable connects it to the computer while coding on the PyPortal.

My first milestone was loading the PyPortal with all the files required to run the program and building the outside shell of the PyPortal. Loading the PyPortal with all the files was easy. Making the shell for the PyPortal also proved to be not much harder. Even without instructions, I was able to put together the shell in about 30 to 45 minutes. I plan to complete this project in the next week or the next 2 weeks.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)

# Starter Project: Retro Arcade Console

# Summary of Build 
Since it was a starter project, the build process was easy. There were instructions that I had to follow and I followed them with relative ease. The only difficulty I had was that I soldered one of the diplay panels incorrectly and it wasn't straight. the way it was oriented made it awkward to press the top button. Other than that, there weren't any difficulties.
